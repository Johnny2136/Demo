| 1.1       | Harold Schliesske - 1. From discussions with Mike Gordon and Kiet Tran, I'd recommend both of them be explicitly identified as System Sustainment Technical liaisons. As such, their role would be to provide some real-world experience to the effort. This designation allows them to contribute but acknowledges they aren't leading the effort and thus won't be doing this full time. 2. Who is paying for the AWS usage? 3. Is this a risk given our feedback from Sang-Im to date on un-clear AWS cost concerns?                                                                                                                                                                             | 1.

| 5.1       | Kiet Tran ? What are the user stories for each sprint? Who are going to be in the team? How many teams are going to be organized? Will all team members / all teams have equal access to the development environment? Will there be shared responsibility, experience and knowledge? Where will be the physical location where team collaborate? Will there be a scrum master dedicated to this team for this effort? Who will own the user stories and thus provide the acceptance criteria? Are we going to adopt any sort of estimation? August 6 is 2 weeks away from Monday. User stories should be available before the sprint start. Should a sprint starts on Wed instead of Monday? | Look in the GitHub project backlog, and yes because of training we are slipping to the right. We are trying to align with the current SAFE practices so if they start on Wed I guess we could as well, but RedHat may need the Mon- Fri approach.                                                                                |
| 7.1       | Kiet Tran ? Should we consider more generic terms? Junit - developer?s tests, SonarQube ? code quality assessment, Selenium ? should be Cucumber ? user?s tests,  Fortify ? security tests. Missing updates to artifactory after build (jars/wars/etc). Deployment should be from artifactory so that version control on the binary can be exercised. Feedback to JIRA can also be from the build process (i.e., SonarQube results, Cucumber results, etc.) Consider using dashboard to represent that status of the pipeline. The content of the delivery should be from the artificatory for version control. Should we have an actual pipeline (you know sort of a straight line thing ?) | Yes the PROP is way too detailed it should be generic, And every attempt will be made to incorporate what's in the current environment if possible.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 7.2       | Kiet Tran ?

| 7.3       | Kiet Tran ? Do you mean CIAP code?

| 9.1       | Sang-Im Moffatt? What automated playbook can be implemented on production?
