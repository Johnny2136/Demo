| 1.1       | Harold Schliesske - 1. From discussions with Mike Gordon and Kiet Tran, I'd recommend both of them be explicitly identified as System Sustainment Technical liaisons. As such, their role would be to provide some real-world experience to the effort. This designation allows them to contribute but acknowledges they aren't leading the effort and thus won't be doing this full time. 2. Who is paying for the AWS usage? 3. Is this a risk given our feedback from Sang-Im to date on un-clear AWS cost concerns?                                                                                                                                                                             | 1.

| 1.2       | Kiet Tran - 1. Should there be a description of why Openshift was selected?  2. What are the benefits that we using Openshift?  3. What is Ansible?  4.

What is Ansible: It is tool to automate deployments and configuration management. How do these relate to DevOps: DevOps is about efficient development operations for faster release of capabilities to business. This is enabled through automation of integration, testing and deployment tasks. In order to support the speed and agility in delivery it is important to maintain consistent configuration across environments. This is made easy through the use of containers. Ansible is used for automating deployments and configuration management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Application containerization is an OS-level virtualization method used to deploy and run distributed applications without launching an entire virtual machine (VM) for each app. 2. Multiple isolated applications or services run on a single host and access the same OS kernel. Containers work on bare-metal systems, cloud instances and virtual machines, across Linux and select Windows and Mac OSes. #3 is yes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3.1       | Steve Pruskowski - I believe that the roles and responsibilities are not clear. 1. How are the current expertise and knowledge of testing and security on the SE&I contract going to be used? 2. Should ME&T be included as an advisor because they have deployed a prototype system that is being transitioned to operations that utilizes OpenShift? 3. Or is this all covered under the statement of NSD, Raytheon and NCPS PMO will be leading this effort with input from:?? 4. If that is the case since only 1 NSD or is called out specifically, should all of the others involved be called out specifically                                                                                   | The first part is an opinion, 1. WE have been looping Chris Dixon in on all the steps we are taking toward the STE. 2. Yes we are looping in ME&T Ed Bolton. 3. It's probably considered as part of NSD, 4.

We are NOT doing CIAP! Our App is called CR18-22 or Yellow Dog, the fact that it is eerily similar to CIAP in a coincidence. If we used CIAP non-suitable folks could not contribute also this app is a "POC only" not to be used beyond the Demo. 2. No we plan to automate the pipeline. 3. No we will not containerize Oracle, and there will be as much automation as possible. |

Since there has been no mention of the application code or features to be developed as part of this project and there is mention of the CIAP team in the previous paragraph, I assume that CIAP is the target application.

| 5.1       | Kiet Tran - 1. What are the user stories for each sprint? 2. Who are going to be in the team? 3. How many teams are going to be organized? 4. Will all team members / all teams have equal access to the development environment? 5. Will there be shared responsibility, experience and knowledge? 6. Where will be the physical location where team collaborate? 7. Will there be a scrum master dedicated to this team for this effort? 8. Who will own the user stories and thus provide the acceptance criteria? 9. Are we going to adopt any sort of estimation? 10. August 6 is 2 weeks away from Monday. User stories should be available before the sprint start. 11. Should a sprint starts on Wed instead of Monday? | 1. Look in the GitHub project backlog, and yes because of training we are slipping to the right. 2. as many folks from Dev/Test/Sec/Ops as we can get we do had some named persons. 3. for 1A only one team comprised of Dev/Sec(test)/Ops. 4. yes 5. Yes 6. 1A will be in the cloud. 7. yes. 8. I imagine I as PM will own them. 9. only what the PMO is contributing. 10 not a question but yes things will slip to the right. 11. We are trying to align with the current SAFE practices so if they start on Wed I guess we could as well, but RedHat may need the Mon- Fri approach.                                                                                |
| 7.1       | Kiet Tran - 1. Should we consider more generic terms? Junit - developer's tests, SonarQube ? code quality assessment, Selenium ? should be Cucumber ? user's tests,  Fortify ? security tests. Missing updates to artifactory after build (jars/wars/etc). Deployment should be from artifactory so that version control on the binary can be exercised. Feedback to JIRA can also be from the build process (i.e., SonarQube results, Cucumber results, etc.) Consider using dashboard to represent that status of the pipeline. The content of the delivery should be from the artificatory for version control. Should we have an actual pipeline (you know sort of a straight line thing ?) | Yes the PROP is way too detailed it should be generic, And every attempt will be made to incorporate what's in the current environment if possible.                                                                                                                                                                              |

This increment doesn't deal with Production at all. Its all going to be either in RedHat Labs environment or AWS cloud. The lessons learned could be leveraged when making design decisions.                                                                                                                                     |
